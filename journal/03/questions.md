# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > | Data abstraction: is the process of hiding unnecessary details of an object’s internal structure. By abstracting an object’s data, its structure and behavior can be kept separate and more easily understood.

Encapsulation: is the process of wrapping data and related functions into a single unit (object). Encapsulation limits access to object data and methods, preventing their misuse and ensuring their proper functioning.

Inheritance: is the ability to create a new class (child class) from an existing one (parent class). The child class typically inherits the attributes (members and methods) of the parent class, although it can also redefine them. 

Polymorphism: is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, as long as they implement a certain interface (have methods of the same name). |

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > | The export statement is used to explicitly export one or more values from a module. It can be use it to export multiple variables, functions, or objects by specifying their names. The export default statement is used to export a single value, function, or object as the default export of a module. |

03. What is Encapsulation?

  > | The process of wrapping data and related functions into a single unit (object). Encapsulation limits access to object data and methods, preventing their misuse and ensuring their proper functioning. |

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > | 
The Proxy object in JavaScript is a powerful feature that allows you to intercept and customize the fundamental operations on an object.  |

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > | A class is a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects. An instance is an actual object created based on that class. |

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > | A computed property in JavaScript is a property that is defined dynamically through an expression or a function call. |

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > | the MVC pattern promotes a structured and organized approach to application development, enhancing maintainability, modularity, and testability while providing flexibility and scalability. |

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > | To handle all data the user sees and interacts with.  |

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > | The job of a Service in MVC is to encapsulate and provide business logic. |

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > | The Model handles data representation. |
