# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. Tasks can run simultaneously. Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation is dependent on the completion of the one before it. |

02. What is an event listener?

  > | An event listener is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur. A simple example of an event is a user clicking the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard. |

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.|

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > | A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some sort action. A higher order function is a function that takes at least one function as an input and/or returns a function as an output. |

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. |

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | Get Post Put|

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | pplication Programming Interface |

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | Use a try catch |

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > |  to restrict the direct access to some components of an object, so users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object.|

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | 200 |

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | 400 Bad Request |
