# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> | Inheritance is a concept in programming where one class can inherit the attributes and behaviors (methods) of another class. It allows you to create new classes based on existing ones, making it easier to reuse code and build relationships between classes. |

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> | The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In simpler terms, it ensures there's only one unique object of that class that can be accessed from anywhere in the program. |

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> | The Observer design pattern is a way for one object to keep an eye on another object and get notified when the second object changes its state. It's like getting updates when something you're interested in changes. |

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> | 
The Strategy design pattern is like having different plans (strategies) to do a task, and you can pick the plan that works best for you. It lets you switch between different ways of doing something without changing the main parts of your program. |

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> | The Factory design pattern is like a specialized machine that makes products (objects) for you. Instead of creating objects directly, you use the factory to create them, which helps you organize and centralize the creation process. |

06. What is test driven development?

> | Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a way to write code where you first create tests that define how your code should work, and then you write the actual code to make those tests pass. It's like building a puzzle: you start with the picture on the box (the tests) and then assemble the pieces (the code) to match that picture. |

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> | In Scrum/Agile, the DoD stands for "Definition of Done." It's a crucial concept that defines the criteria or conditions that a product increment or user story must meet to be considered complete and ready for delivery. The DoD helps ensure that everyone on the development team has a shared understanding of what "done" means for each work item, which enhances transparency and quality in the development process. |

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> | User Story: User Registration
As a new website user,
I want to create an account
so that I can access exclusive content and personalize my experience.

(This user story represents a common feature where a user can register on a website to gain access to additional features.)

User Story: Shopping Cart
As an online shopper,
I want to add products to my shopping cart,
so that I can review and purchase them later.

(This user story describes the ability for a user to add items to their shopping cart while shopping online.) |

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> | AThe Sprint Backlog in Scrum is created during the "Sprint Planning" ceremony. |

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> | Scrum Master |
